## Abstract
This was my first hobby project in programming, where i tried to create a discord bot which can have fun interactions with the user. The bot(when it used to work) can respond to certain messages, warn users if messages are spammed, can join voice channels, and finally its best part - a tic-tac-toe game(pvp) by using emote reactions. This was done entirely using java with the JDA(java discord API). As for the audio playing part - it was based on ["lavaplayer"](https://github.com/sedmelluq/lavaplayer) by [sedmelluq](https://github.com/sedmelluq/), so props to them!
